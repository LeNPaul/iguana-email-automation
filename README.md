# iguana-email-automation

Iguana channels for running Python scripts for automating email processes. Contains two channels - one channel enables the email autoresponder, and the other disables the email autoresponder. This channel is to be used in combination with the [email-automation](https://github.com/LeNPaul/email-automation) script.

### To Do
 * Update scheduling module for more refined scheduling ability.
   * Instead of running one task once a day every day, run more than one task and be able to customize times of the day, which days, etc.
 * Combine two channels into one.
